<!-- ---------------------------------------------------  -->
[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, which is based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

This course aims to offer students hands-on experience on deep learning algorithms.
Students will be able to familiarize basic python packages for deep learning, computer vision concepts for deep learning, sequence modelling, recurrent neural network also. 
This course helps the learners to enhance the capability to design and implement a deep learning architecture for a real time application.

Prerequisite: A sound knowledge in python programming, machine learning concepts, deep 
learning algorithms
